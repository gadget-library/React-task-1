            I am 19 years old and I was born in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India. I
            am a person who prefers to be alone(not single üòÖ) and be lost in my
            thoughts. I am a very silent and observant person who may complain
            about simple things. The only thing I desire is to stay happy and
            have a lot of money.

            I have always been a tech-savvy person and I continue to be one. I
            have keen interest in coding and development. Some of the
            technologies I am aware of are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.Js,
            Python, C++, C. I have already secured second and third positions in
            two state level hackathons üòÅ. I also have a lot of interest in
            playing with various hardware as well.

            Graphic Designing was never one of my interests, but once I joined
            my college I was introduced to ECell-RGPV. They introduced me to the
            world of graphic designing and I fell in love ‚ù§Ô∏è. Now I can
            confidently say I can design very professional looking posters using
            Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. Feel free to hire meüòÅ.

            I am a natural photographer. I can find really cool and creative
            ways to take pictures of the same subject multiple times. Once I
            learned graphic designing, that made an even better photographer. I
            also have a DSLR and a really good phone(mostly used) for capturing
            photos.

            I cannot express in words how much I love music. I listen to the old
            kind of music like John Denver and Elvis Presley. I can play quite a
            few instruments as well like piano, violin, kongo, xylophone, flute
            and more. To give you some perspective, I listen to music at least
            three hours each day.
